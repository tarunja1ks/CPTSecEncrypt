## CPT project
Welcome to the Binary Encryption/Decryption Project homepage! This project aims to implement a binary encryption and decryption system using [insert your preferred programming language or tool here].

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to develop a tool that can encrypt plaintext messages into binary format and then decrypt them back into readable text using a specified encryption algorithm.

## Features

- **Binary Encryption**: Convert plaintext messages into binary format.
- **Binary Decryption**: Convert binary-encoded messages back into readable text using ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. 

- **User Interface**: Login System, options to add a profile picture, and options to get all the history of your previous encrypted values

## Technologies Used

- Using Make and also github for version control and more

## Contributions
- My teacher(John Mortensen) had created a template for the class to use, which includes the makefile, an EMPTY homepage file, gemfile, converting notebooks to markdown script, basic layouts, which have easily allowed me to edit menu-bar options and customize, backend functions in api/user.py, that have allowed for login and signup to take place although I intergated the javascript apifetch functions, migrate script to create the database, Model/user.py file mainly however I have created the class Binary inside of it

- Some classmates have also helped me with some of the website styling, but I have still contributed to a lot of it, including some box shadows

- My contributions include the backend folder of all scripts and AI code that was used for encryption and decryption, class _BinaryCipher and class Images in the api/user.py, the frontend api-call javascript that converts images into base64 and sends to database, frontend styling for glows, the main encryption/decryption/history-of-encryption features, and also the edit profile feature
